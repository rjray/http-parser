Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Parser.

0.04  2007-11-10
  - when parsing chunks, only remove current chunk from data buffer; don't
     clear it (rt.cpan.org #30005, patch from David Cannings)
  - in the "be lenient in what you accept" vein, allow the HTTP response
     status line to not have a space after the version (contrary to RFC 2616
     6.1, but apparently broken implementations exist), and strip whitespace
     from the Content-Length header (rt.cpan.org #30338, patch from David
     Cannings)

0.03  2007-02-24
  - reverse change file order (now reverse chronological, newest first)
  - change chunk parser to skip chunk-extension and allow spaces (rt.cpan.org
     #14092)
  - add ability to parse HTTP response into HTTP::Response too (rt.cpan.org
     #7652, 7654, based on patch from mfr AT hybyte DOT com)
  - added new tests for new response parsing capability

0.02  2004-01-28
  - incorporate fixes proposed by Anthony D. Minkoff <adminkoff@cox.net>:
    literal "HTTP" should be case insensitive (RFC 2616, sections 2.1, 3.1)
    allow blank lines before Request-Line (RFC 2616, section 4.1; "SHOULD")
